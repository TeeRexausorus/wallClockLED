# wallClockLED
A project started during the second lock down in France, for "L'Exploratoire" as a gift.

This project consists in a 3D printed wall decoration, and a RGB LED strip to light the decoration from inside.

The FastLED library is used in this project.

Here is a picture of the design. (I hope there will few revisions after printing)

For now, I have no idea what to display, other than a clock.
